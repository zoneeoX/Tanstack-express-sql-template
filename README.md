üëç This project is a robust full-stack CRUD application built with modern web development tools to streamline development and enhance performance. The frontend leverages React with TypeScript (TSC) for a scalable, maintainable, and type-safe codebase, while TanStack Router ensures efficient navigation and TanStack Query handles state and server-side data management seamlessly. On the backend, the application is powered by Express and Node.js, providing a lightweight and flexible architecture, with MySQL as the database for reliable data storage and manipulation. Key features include comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality, basic authentication with token-based security, and role-based authorization for effective access control. The environment is fully pre-configured, making it an excellent starting point for developing modern, scalable, and developer-friendly web applications.
